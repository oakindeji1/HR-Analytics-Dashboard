# HR-Analytics-Dashboard
## Excel Dashboard from start to end Project | HR Analytics Dashboard 

### Project Overview
#### We will see the design and development of a beautiful dashboard in Microsoft Excel as we can see from the topic: HR analytics dashboard. I have used some of the slicers on this dashboard which when operated with respect to this particular slicers like for gender you can see this is completely Dynamic and I have used some extra filters as well and if I'm operating this you can see the data is changing with respect to that education field and you can take a Insight from this particular dashboard or HR department can take Insight from this dashboard like with respect to education Fields how the company is performing and this dashboard is focused on attrition right so iteration is nothing but the employees who are leaving the company so how many employees are living by age, by gender, by marital status by job role Etc so we have one more sliser like Department if you can see whenever I'm operating this the values are changing with respect to that aspect all right so let's discuss on different components which are there on this particular dashboard.
